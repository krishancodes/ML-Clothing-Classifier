# 🧠 ML Clothing Classifier

A machine learning project that classifies clothing images using TensorFlow and Numpy.  
**This project is part of my internship under the domain Google AI/ML, offered via AICTE Eduskills.**  
It explores how neural networks can be used for image classification tasks and is a stepping stone in my learning journey into AI/ML.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `clothing.py` - Main Python script to load, train, and evaluate the model.
- `requirements.txt` - List of required Python packages.
- `.gitignore` - Files and folders ignored by Git.

## 🚀 Features

- Trains a neural network using the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- Predicts categories like shirts, trousers, bags, and more.
- Visualizes model predictions and accuracy.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11**
- **TensorFlow**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishancodes/ML-Clothing-Classifier.git
